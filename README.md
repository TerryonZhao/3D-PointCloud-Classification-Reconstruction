## Project Overview

Understanding and reconstructing 3D shapes from data is a fundamental challenge in robotics, virtual reality, and computer vision. This project introduces deep learning techniques for 3D shape classification and reconstruction using the ModelNet10 dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks for point cloud analysis. We develop and evaluate models for object classification and explore methods for reconstructing incomplete 3D shapes from limited or occluded data. Through this project, we gain practical experience in 3D deep learning and understand the challenges and techniques involved in recognizing and reconstructing 3D objects from partial information.

## 🔍 Detailed Results

### Classification Performance

The PointNet++ based classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 91.19% on the ModelNet10 test set. Below is a summary of the per-class performance:

| Class       | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| bathtub     | 0.98      | 0.86   | 0.91     | 50      |
| bed         | 0.93      | 0.99   | 0.96     | 100     |
| chair       | 0.99      | 0.99   | 0.99     | 100     |
| desk        | 0.88      | 0.78   | 0.83     | 86      |
| dresser     | 0.83      | 0.79   | 0.81     | 86      |
| monitor     | 1.00      | 0.99   | 0.99     | 100     |
| night_stand | 0.69      | 0.78   | 0.73     | 86      |
| sofa        | 0.91      | 1.00   | 0.95     | 100     |
| table       | 0.92      | 0.87   | 0.89     | 100     |
| toilet      | 1.00      | 0.99   | 0.99     | 100     |

Key observations:
- Highest performance on monitor and toilet classes (99% F1-score)
- Most challenging class was night_stand (73% F1-score)
- Confusion primarily occurred between geometrically similar classes (desk/table, dresser/night_stand)

### Point Cloud Completion Performance

Our Point Cloud Completion Network (PCN) showed impressive performance in reconstructing complete 3D shapes from partial inputs. The model achieved a steady decrease in Chamfer Distance loss through training:

- Training started with a loss of 0.106
- By epoch 10, the loss decreased to 0.026
- Fine-grained completion showed better results than coarse reconstruction

The training progression demonstrates the model's ability to learn increasingly accurate 3D shape representations.

### Reconstruction Comparisons

Comparing different visibility levels and reconstruction methods:

1. **Chair Reconstruction**: Visualization shows improved detail recovery even with only 50% visibility

2. **Table Reconstruction**: The network successfully reconstructs complex geometrical features

3. **Comparison with FoldingNet**: PCN demonstrates superior performance in maintaining fine details
   ![PCN vs FoldingNet](/results/reconstruction_PCN/fine_pcn_vs_fdn.png)

4. **Classification vs Reconstruction**: Joint analysis showing correlation between classification confidence and reconstruction accuracy
   ![Classification vs Reconstruction](/results/reconstruction_PCN/classification_vs_reconstruction_with_pcn.png)

The results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively handles 3D shape classification and reconstruction from partial point clouds, with particularly strong performance on objects with distinctive geometric features.
